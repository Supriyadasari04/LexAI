# ⚖️ LexAI - Your Smart Legal Assistant

**LexAI** is an AI-powered legal assistant designed to streamline and simplify the day-to-day workflow of advocates and legal professionals.

At its core, LexAI is built to **intelligently handle client consultations**, **extract key insights**, and help advocates **prioritize their workload** with precision.

## 🧠 Key Capabilities

- **Conversational Intake**: LexAI interacts with clients in a chat-based format to gather essential details like name, gender, occupation, and the reason for seeking legal help.
  
- **Automated Case Summarization**: After the conversation, LexAI generates a concise and structured summary of the interaction, highlighting critical information about the case.

- **Smart Case Management Dashboard**: All client summaries are stored and visualized in a dynamic advocate dashboard. The dashboard allows for:
  - 🔍 Searching cases by email or case ID
  - 📅 Sorting cases by appointment date
  - 🟡 Filtering by case status (e.g., Pending, Reviewed, Accepted)
  - ✅ Quick actions like “Mark as Reviewed”

- **Document Summarization Module**: LexAI also allows users to upload legal documents (PDFs). The tool uses **OCR (if needed)** and **open-source language models** (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`) to generate a client-friendly summary of the document—perfect for quick insights on lengthy contracts or case files.

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of LexAI is to reduce the manual burden on advocates by:
- Automating the **client intake** and **summary documentation**
- Offering a centralized system to **view, filter, and manage client cases**
- Providing tools for **quick comprehension** of lengthy legal documents
